## Description

The purpose of this application is to help manage a scout group or similar organisation. Scout groups have a range of processes, from planning weekly programs to larger activities to building maintenance.

Currently, there are existing systems that assist in managing scout groups, but these are often fragmented or leave significant gaps as they are not specifically tailored to our needs. This situation often forces each group to create their own system, often spreadsheets for days, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies. This project aims to address this issue by providing a comprehensive solution for one scout group.

One significant point that I hope to address is the delegation of tasks within a volunteer organisation. Task allocation could benefit from having a shared to-do list that is allocated based on two primary weights: required skills and available time. So that people can help out when they have time and spread the load.
Often, tasks are left undelegated and remain the chore of the ‘manager’ because the top is too busy to find someone with the available time and required skills
